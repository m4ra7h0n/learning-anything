/**
 * An {@link ApplicationListener} that halts application startup if the system file
 * encoding does not match an expected value set in the environment. By default has no
 * effect, but if you set {@code spring.mandatory_file_encoding} (or some camelCase or
 * UPPERCASE variant of that) to the name of a character encoding (e.g. "UTF-8") then this
 * initializer throws an exception when the {@code file.encoding} System property does not
 * equal it.
 *
 * <p>
 * The System property {@code file.encoding} is normally set by the JVM in response to the
 * {@code LANG} or {@code LC_ALL} environment variables. It is used (along with other
 * platform-dependent variables keyed off those environment variables) to encode JVM
 * arguments as well as file names and paths. In most cases you can override the file
 * encoding System property on the command line (with standard JVM features), but also
 * consider setting the {@code LANG} environment variable to an explicit
 * character-encoding value (e.g. "en_GB.UTF-8").
