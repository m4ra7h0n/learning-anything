### New Queries

* The query `java/insufficient-key-size` has been promoted from experimental to the main query pack. Its results will now appear by default. This query was originally [submitted as an experimental query by @luchua-bc](https://github.com/github/codeql/pull/4926).
* Added a new query, `java/android/sensitive-keyboard-cache`, to detect instances of sensitive information possibly being saved to the Android keyboard cache.
