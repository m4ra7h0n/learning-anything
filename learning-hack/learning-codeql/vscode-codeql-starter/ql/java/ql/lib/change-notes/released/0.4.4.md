## 0.4.4

### New Features

* Kotlin support is now in beta. This means that Java analyses will also include Kotlin code by default. Kotlin support can be disabled by setting `CODEQL_EXTRACTOR_JAVA_AGENT_DISABLE_KOTLIN` to `true` in the environment.
* The new `string Compilation.getInfo(string)` predicate provides access to some information about compilations.

### Minor Analysis Improvements

* The ReDoS libraries in `semmle.code.java.security.regexp` has been moved to a shared pack inside the `shared/` folder, and the previous location has been deprecated.
* Added data flow summaries for tainted Android intents sent to activities via `Activity.startActivities`.
