## 0.4.4

### Minor Analysis Improvements

* Data flow through the `ActiveSupport` extension `Enumerable#index_by` is now modeled.
* The `codeql.ruby.Concepts` library now has a `SqlConstruction` class, in addition to the existing `SqlExecution` class.
* Calls to `Arel.sql` are now modeled as instances of the new `SqlConstruction` concept.
* Arguments to RPC endpoints (public methods) on subclasses of `ActionCable::Channel::Base` are now recognized as sources of remote user input.
* Taint flow through the `ActiveSupport` extensions `Hash#reverse_merge` and `Hash:reverse_merge!`, and their aliases, is now modeled more generally, where previously it was only modeled in the context of `ActionController` parameters.
* Calls to `logger` in `ActiveSupport` actions are now recognised as logger instances.
* Calls to `send_data` in `ActiveSupport` actions are recognised as HTTP responses.
* Calls to `body_stream` in `ActiveSupport` actions are recognised as HTTP request accesses.
* The `ActiveSupport` extensions `Object#try` and `Object#try!` are now recognised as code executions.
