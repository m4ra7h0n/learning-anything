## 0.4.3

### Minor Analysis Improvements

* There was a bug in `TaintTracking::localTaint` and `TaintTracking::localTaintStep` such that they only tracked non-value-preserving flow steps. They have been fixed and now also include value-preserving steps.
* Instantiations using `Faraday::Connection.new` are now recognized as part of `FaradayHttpRequest`s, meaning they will be considered as sinks for queries such as `rb/request-forgery`.
* Taint flow is now tracked through extension methods on `Hash`, `String` and
  `Object` provided by `ActiveSupport`.
